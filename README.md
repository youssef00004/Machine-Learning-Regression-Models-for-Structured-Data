# Machine-Learning-Regression-Models-for-Structured-Data
This project compares multiple regression techniques on a structured dataset to predict a continuous target variable. It include data preprocessing, model training, and test prediction export. The following models are implemented using validation techniques: SVR.  Decision Tree Regressor .  Polynomial Regression .  Random Forest Regressor
